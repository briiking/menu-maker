# menu-maker

For this project you will be creating a simulation of a menu at a (fast food) restaurant. For example, the menu might consist of: 
'''
#1 Double Double Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
#2 Cheese Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
#3 Hamburger with Fries and a Soft Drink
etc.

I encourage  you to get creative. Pick you favorite restaurant and populate with fun options. However, you must number the options (details below).
