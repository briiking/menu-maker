# menu-maker

## Introduction
For this project you will be creating a simulation of a menu at a (fast food) restaurant. For example, the menu might consist of: 

1. Double Double Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
2. Cheese Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
3. Hamburger with Fries and a Soft Drink
4. etc.

I encourage  you to get creative. Pick you favorite restaurant and populate with fun options. However, you must number the options (details below). 

## Instructions
There is a lot of room for additional features (and points!) in this lab. 
Your program **must** have the following:
- [ ] Prompt the user with a *numbered* menu with at least 5 items
- [ ] Collect the user's choice
  * If the user's choice is invalid you should tell them
- [ ] Confirm the user's order 
  *e.g. "You ordered a Double Double Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink, is that correct?"
- [ ] Thank the user and SHOUT the order to the kitchen after it is confirmed
