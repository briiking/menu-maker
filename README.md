# Advanced Topics Lab: Menu Maker

## Introduction
For this project you will be creating a simulation of a menu at a (fast food) restaurant. For example, the menu might consist of: 

1. Double Double Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
2. Cheese Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink
3. Hamburger with Fries and a Soft Drink
4. etc.

I encourage  you to get creative. Pick you favorite restaurant and populate with fun options. However, you must number the options (details below). 

## Instructions
There is a lot of room for additional features (and points!) in this lab. 
Your program **must** have the following:
- [ ] Prompt the user with a *numbered* menu with at least 5 items
- [ ] Collect the user's choice
  * If the user's choice is invalid you should tell them
  * It should **not** be case sensitive (you know methods for that...)
- [ ] Confirm the user's order 
  * e.g. "You ordered a Double Double Burger with Fries and a Soft Drink, is that correct?"
- [ ] Thank the user and SHOUT the order to the kitchen after it is confirmed

### Take it further
If you finish the above requirements (which you must do at a minimum), give these additional challenges (each worth multiple points) a try:
- [ ] Allow the user to enter the order number OR the order name 
  * *e.g. "1" or "double double with fries and a soft drink")*
- [ ] Ask the user if they would like a side with their order each time, and give them a choice of sides
- [ ] Allow the user to order multiple items 
  * Challenge: add a price to those items and tell them the price
- [ ] When you thank the user, pick from a variety of options
  * *e.g. "Thanks for your order" or "Have a wonderful day" or have a snarky waiter...*

Good luck :+1:
